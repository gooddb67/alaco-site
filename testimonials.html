  <h3>Testimonials From Parents Who Gave Their Children Unto Him</h3>
  <p>
    “We gave nothing but love to our Ashley until Steven helped us realize the
    love of a biological parent is poison to a child. We still miss her. My
    husband cries daily, but Steven says that’s normal. What gets us through the
    day is how many lives she’ll save on Resonant Day because of how selfless we
    were.” - Audrey P.

    “When Steven made us burn all our pictures of Anthony we thought that may be
    crossing a line, but 7 months later it was the best decision we ever made.
    Sometimes Anthony waves to us so we know he’s doing alright, too.” - Oscar
    N.

    “We have deep, meaningful lives now without Gina. Sometimes I’ll be down in
    the workshop crafting mops for 82 hours straight! It’s hard work, but the
    recordings of Steven keep me going. Besides, without Steven guiding our
    kids, how do you people think we’re gonna make it through Resonant Day? I
    hope one day the people wake up and realize that Steven is the only parent
    our children need!” - Gayle R.
