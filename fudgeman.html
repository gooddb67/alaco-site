<h3>The Book of Fudgeman</h3>

<p>Elliott Murphy was my name. Or rather, someone else’s.</p>
<br />

<p>For Fudgeman was born anew.</p>
<br />

<p>
  No longer beholden to the triflings of the outer quadrants - friendship,
  macaronis - I saw Him in all his blinding glory.
</p>
<br />

<p>
  Your corporeal form mighty from javelins, hammer throws and racewalking, you
  are ready to combat the Visitors, yes – but it is until you ascend that you
  can vanquish.
</p>
<br />

<p>The Visitors. That which you were.</p>
<br />

<p>
  My brethren. My sisters. Heed The Angel Of The Red Wood. And on Resonant Day,
  we shall be as Coach P intoned: We shall give it our all. We shall go out
  there and get them.
</p>
<br />

<p>We will triumph.</p>
