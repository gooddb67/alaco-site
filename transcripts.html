    “I’ll need complete silence now. It’s important you all keep as still as
    possible as I’m finding my senses particularly heightened today. Still…keep
    still…Patrick even more still, please. I’m going to speak about The
    Quadraform. The Quadraform, when assembled correctly and truthfully,
    generates an energy blast strong enough to dispatch 200 Visitors. The
    Quadraform is how we will defeat The Visitors on Resonant Day, children.
    There are four parallel areas within a Quadraform and each one of you will
    fill a role within your own Quadraform.

    First is the Authentic. The Authentic is a strong, physical specimen of a
    child. But indeed he is dumb. Casey is an Authentic. He requires little
    physical training but on his own could not bare the mental fortitude
    required on Resonant Day.

    Then we have the Leaver. Elle, my flower, you are a Leaver. You have left
    Jesus for the true path. To be a Leaver requires deep emotional strength one
    would have to possess to betray their savior. Elle, you have betrayed Jesus,
    thus, you are strong. This is what makes a Leaver, children.

    The Consumer is of vital importance in The Quadraform, as they ingest the
    radioactive particles emitted by The Visitors. Elliott is our best Consumer.
    He does nothing but consume. Food, television. He doesn’t stop. It’s
    pathetic in many ways, yes, but it is the tolerance they have for consuming
    poison that make them a necessary tool in protecting us from The Visitors.

    Finally, there is the Child Pure of Heart and Mind. Come up here, Mikey. Sit
    on Steven’s lap. Everyone look at Mikey. Do you see he is naked, and yet he
    has his robes on? He is mentally naked. His soul and mind are NAKED! NAKED!
    There is deep purity in nakedness that The Visitors will bow upon. This is
    fourth and most important of the parallel areas. Without the Naked Child we
    are blood dust. Mikey is a naked child. Who else here is a naked child. Let
    me find you. Let me find you…”
